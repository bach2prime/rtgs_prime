//return ack

get from in type=11 : branchwise (see returnItemFinal)
get the file name
replace .xml with .ack
find in ack folder (same as outward finalize)
show the file

another approach

set a link in ReturnItem.aspx page 
get ret item from parent id
get file name and check if exists and contains ok




//user report - done

public string BranchNameExt added in usereft class

make a report rdlc done
dal fnc are ready done
add to user page in admin done


========== archive report ==============

1. inward items by branch - 
	
	groupby recvBankName -> recvBranchName in rdlc

2.	in ret
	complex for fetching parentSettDate -> leave it, make it simple like out items



SELECT     COUNT(EdrInId) AS Expr1, SUBSTRING(OrigBank, 1, 3) AS Expr2, SUM(AmountCr) AS Expr3, SUM(AmountDr) AS Expr4
FROM         EdrBatchIn
WHERE     (SettlementDate >= '2012-08-14') AND (BankCode = '035') AND (SettlementDate < '2012-08-15') AND (ItemType = 10)
GROUP BY SUBSTRING(OrigBank, 1, 3)


============ zone report ============
				
				group by
				------------------
in item			receivingBankRt
in ret			routingnumber

out item		routingnumber
out ret			nothing -> put it in AdviceRt

zone
-------------
routing -> district code-> zone -> branch

>> update advicert for zone settlement report for OutRet

update EdrIn  set AdviceRT = edr1.ReceivingBankRt 
  from EdrIn as edr1  inner join EdrIn  on edr1.EdrInId=EdrIn.ParentEdrIn  
  where EdrIn.ItemType = 11

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

>> update ReceivingBankRt 8 -> 9 digit

update EdrIn  set ReceivingBankRt = b.RoutingNo 
 from OtherBranch as b  inner join EdrIn  on SUBSTRING(b.RoutingNo,1,8) =EdrIn.ReceivingBankRt
 where len(EdrIn.ReceivingBankRt) = 8
